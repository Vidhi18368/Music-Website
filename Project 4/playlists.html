				<h2>Slow And Reverbed Bollywood</h2>
				<p>A reverb, is created when a sound or signal is reflected causing numerous 
                    reflections to build up and then decay as the sound is absorbed by the 
                    surfaces of objects in the space â€“ which could include furniture, people, 
                    and air. This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the 
                    reflections continue, their amplitude decreasing, until zero is reached. 
                    Reverberation is not limited to indoor spaces as it exists in forests and 
                    other outdoor environments where reflection exists.</p>

				<h2>Lofi Bollywood</h2>
				<p>Lo-fi is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded 
                    as imperfections of a recording or performance are audible, sometimes as 
                    a deliberate aesthetic choice. The standards of sound quality and music 
                    production have evolved throughout the decades, meaning that some older 
                    examples of lo-fi may not have been originally recognized as such. 
                    Lo-fi began to be recognized as a style of popular music in the 1990s, 
                    when it became alternately referred to as DIY music </p>

				<h2>2021 Lofi Chill</h2>
				<p>Lofi's simplicity and ability to help listeners focus are some of its
                     main selling points. It's perhaps no surprise then that the genre 
                     would take off in a time when prolonged use of social media has 
                     caused many to feel anxious, depressed and overwhelmed. 
                     Lofi is calming and relaxing to listen to.</p>

				<h2>HipHop Slowed And Reverb</h2>
				<p>Every recording room adds some kind of reverb. So singers and rappers 
                    tend to record in vocal booths or using vocal curtains, and perform 
                    into mics that are close by. Then, reverb is added digitally 
                    (or sometimes acoustically) as part of the production process. </p>
